"# Script to perform batch anonymous ftp. Essentially converts a list of\n"
"# of command-line arguments into input to ftp.\n"
"# ==> This script is nothing but a shell wrapper around \"ftp\" . . .\n"
"# Simple, and quick - written as a companion to ftplist \n"
"# -h specifies the remote host (default prep.ai.mit.edu) \n"
"# -d specifies the remote directory to cd to - you can provide a sequence \n"
"# of -d options - they will be cd'ed to in turn. If the paths are relative, \n"
"# make sure you get the sequence right. Be careful with relative paths - \n"
"# there are far too many symlinks nowadays.  \n"
"# (default is the ftp login directory)\n"
"# -v turns on the verbose option of ftp, and shows all responses from the \n"
"# ftp server.  \n"
"# -f remotefile[:localfile] gets the remote file into localfile \n"
"# -m pattern does an mget with the specified pattern. Remember to quote \n"
"# shell characters.  \n"
"# -c does a local cd to the specified directory\n"
"# For example, \n"
"# \tftpget -h expo.lcs.mit.edu -d contrib -f xplaces.shar:xplaces.sh \\\n"
"#\t\t-d ../pub/R3/fixes -c ~/fixes -m 'fix*' \n"
"# will get xplaces.shar from ~ftp/contrib on expo.lcs.mit.edu, and put it\n"
"# in xplaces.sh in the current working directory, and get all fixes from\n"
"# ~ftp/pub/R3/fixes and put them in the ~/fixes directory. \n"
"# Obviously, the sequence of the options is important, since the equivalent\n"
"# commands are executed by ftp in corresponding order\n"
