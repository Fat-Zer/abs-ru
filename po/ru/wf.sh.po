"#  Arun Giridhar suggests modifying the above to:\n"
"#  . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort +1 [-f] | sort +0 -nr\n"
"#  This adds a secondary sort key, so instances of\n"
"#+ equal occurrence are sorted alphabetically.\n"
"#  As he explains it:\n"
"#  \"This is effectively a radix sort, first on the\n"
"#+ least significant column\n"
"#+ (word or string, optionally case-insensitive)\n"
"#+ and last on the most significant column (frequency).\"\n"

"#  As Frank Wang explains, the above is equivalent to\n"
"#+       . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort +0 -nr\n"
"#+ and the following also works:\n"
"#+       . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr -k\n"
