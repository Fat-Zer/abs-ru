"# Consider a perfectly square plot of land, 10000 units on a side.  # This "
"land has a perfectly circular lake in its center, #+ with a diameter of "
"10000 units.  # The plot is actually mostly water, except for land in the "
"four corners.  # (Think of it as a square with an inscribed circle.)  # # We "
"will fire iron cannonballs from an old-style cannon #+ at the square.  # All "
"the shots impact somewhere on the square, #+ either in the lake or on the "
"dry corners.  # Since the lake takes up most of the area, #+ most of the "
"shots will SPLASH! into the water.  # Just a few shots will THUD! into solid "
"ground #+ in the four corners of the square.  # # If we take enough random, "
"unaimed shots at the square, #+ Then the ratio of SPLASHES to total shots "
"will approximate #+ the value of PI/4.  # # The simplified explanation is "
"that the cannon is actually #+ shooting only at the upper right-hand "
"quadrant of the square, #+ i.e., Quadrant I of the Cartesian coordinate "
"plane.  # # # Theoretically, the more shots taken, the better the fit.  # "
"However, a shell script, as opposed to a compiled language #+ with "
"floating-point math built in, requires some compromises.  # This decreases "
"the accuracy of the simulation."
