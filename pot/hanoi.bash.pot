"#=================================================================#\n"
"#  The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle attributed to\n"
"#+ Edouard Lucas, a nineteenth-century French mathematician.\n"
"#\n"
"#  There are three vertical posts set in a base.\n"
"#  The first post has a set of annular rings stacked on it.\n"
"#  These rings are disks with a hole drilled out of the center,\n"
"#+ so they can slip over the posts and rest flat.\n"
"#  The rings have different diameters, and they stack in ascending\n"
"#+ order, according to size.\n"
"#  The smallest ring is on top, and the largest on the bottom.\n"
"#\n"
"#  The task is to transfer the stack of rings\n"
"#+ to one of the other posts.\n"
"#  You can move only one ring at a time to another post.\n"
"#  You are permitted to move rings back to the original post.\n"
"#  You may place a smaller ring atop a larger one,\n"
"#+ but *not* vice versa.\n"
"#  Again, it is forbidden to place a larger ring atop a smaller one.\n"
"#\n"
"#  For a small number of rings, only a few moves are required.\n"
"#+ For each additional ring,\n"
"#+ the required number of moves approximately doubles,\n"
"#+ and the \"strategy\" becomes increasingly complicated.\n"
"#\n"
"#  For more information, see http://hanoi.kernelthread.com\n"
