"# Exercises:\n"
"# ---------\n"
"# 1)  Modify the script to accept any type of alphabetic input\n"
"#   + (uppercase, lowercase, mixed case), and convert it\n"
"#   + to an acceptable format for processing.\n"
"#\n"
"# 2)  Convert the script to a GUI application,\n"
"#   + using something like 'gdialog' or 'zenity' . . .\n"
"#     The script will then no longer take its argument(s)\n"
"#   + from the command-line.\n"
"#\n"
"# 3)  Modify the script to parse one of the other available\n"
"#   + Public Domain Dictionaries, such as the U.S. Census Bureau "
"Gazetteer.\n"
