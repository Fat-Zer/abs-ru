"# The notorious \"hailstone\" or Collatz series.  # "
"------------------------------------------- # 1) Get the integer \"seed\" "
"from the command-line.  # 2) NUMBER &lt;-- seed # 3) Print NUMBER.  # 4)  If "
"NUMBER is even, divide by 2, or # 5)+ if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.  # 6) "
"NUMBER &lt;-- result # 7) Loop back to step 3 (for specified number of "
"iterations).  # # The theory is that every such sequence, #+ no matter how "
"large the initial value, #+ eventually settles down to repeating "
"\"4,2,1...\" cycles, #+ even after fluctuating through a wide range of "
"values.  # # This is an instance of an \"iterate,\" #+ an operation that "
"feeds its output back into its input.  # Sometimes the result is a "
"\"chaotic\" series."
